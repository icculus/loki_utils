# loki_utils

These are some simple utility and helper functions that Loki Software
used in all their games.

I don't know if these are useful 20+ years later, but they're here if
you want them, or are curious what sort of common code might have been
needed to be used in every Loki title.

No one is maintaining this code, but I'll accept pull requests.
